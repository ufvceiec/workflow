    "Split the data into train, validation/dev and test. Mostly validation and test should correspond to the same distribution (there are exceptions). Depending on the amount of data 80% are used for the training stage and 20% for the test stage. If there are really big amount of data (like hundreds of thousands), you can use a bigger percentage for training. Decide if data should be randomly chosen depending on its nature, for example if we are working with video similar frames could be used on training and test which could lead to a bias. Data used during training stage are also split into 80-20 which are the training set and the validation set. Use k-fold cross validation.\n",
